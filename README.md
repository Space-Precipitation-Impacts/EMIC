# EMIC
EMIC wave projects and discussions. 

Data folder includes the CRRES EMIC wave lists used in A.J. Halford, PhD, and subsequent papers. These waves were identified by eye.   

I've also uploaded the IDL programs from my PhD Some are definitely drafts or old versions. I plan to review and clean up the content to include only the finished, finalized programs used in the thesis and subsequent papers. However, since I do not have a working version of IDL, this will take time and likely result in mistakes. So please be warned if you are planning on using these programs.
