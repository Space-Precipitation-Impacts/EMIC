Release Notes for December 1, 1999:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Notes:

This is the first release of the CRRES "fiche" program in many years
and so this release is not well tested.

This release is compiled for Solaris 2.7 ONLY.  It will probably
not work on Solaris 2.6 or earlier.


PLEASE note that, in this release, the program is set up to allow
for more independent usage by different users.  Carefully read the
section, below, entitled:

    User Setup for the CRRES "fiche" program

Also note that you now invoke the program with the command:

   runfiche

At one point in the distant past, you merely entered the command:

   run

This is too generic a name for this very specific application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing the Crres "fiche" program at a remote site:
-----------------------------------------------------

1.  First, decide where the release will be installed on your local network.
    In this example, we will assume that you want to install in the directory:

	/disks/software/crres/fiche

    If you already have an existing "fiche" installation in this directory,
    you should rename:

	/disks/software/crres/fiche

    and recreate it with the commands:

	mkdir /disks/software/crres/fiche
	chmod a+rx /disks/software/crres/fiche

    Note that the "chmod" command will insure that all users will be able
    to execute programs from the directory.  They do NOT need to have write
    permissions to this directory.

2.  The latest version of the CRRES "fiche" program is available via
    anonymous FTP at:

	polar2.ssl.berkeley.edu

    The release is a modestly-sized TAR file (about 4 MBytes) and can be
    retrieved from the anonymous site as follows:

    a).   Login as the user who owns directory:

	      /disks/software/crres/fiche

          Then move into this direction:

	      cd  /disks/software/crres/fiche 

    b).   Anonymously FTP into:

	      polar2.ssl.berkeley.edu

    c).   Use "ftp" to bring over the release (the "tar" file and a
	  "README" file):

              ftp > binary

              ftp > cd /pub/crres

              ftp > get fiche.tar

              ftp > get README

              ftp > quit

    d).   On your local system, you should now see, in directory:

	      /disks/software/crres/fiche

	  the two files:

	      READMD
	      fiche.tar

	  Unpack the release by "tar":

	      cd  /disks/software/crres/fiche 

	      tar xvf fiche.tar

	  If you wish, you can now remove the "tar" file:

	      rm fiche.tar

    e).   The latest version of "fiche" is now installed on your local network.
	  Each user interested in running the "fiche" program should now go
	  to the section entitled:

              User Setup for the CRRES "fiche" program:

	  to set up the environment variables to successfully run the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Setup for the CRRES "fiche" program:
----------------------------------------

As of 1999, "fiche" requires each user to set several environment variables to
be able to run the program.   The following is a description of these
environment variables:

 1.  CRRES_FICHE_BIN

	 This is the location of program as installed locally in the section
	 entitled:
	
             Installing the Crres "fiche" program at a remote site:

	 In the example given in that section, the user should, near the end of
	 their ".cshrc" file, put the 2 lines:

	     setenv CRRES_FICHE_BIN  /disks/software/crres/fiche 

	     set path=($path $CRRES_FICHE_BIN)

         This will ensure that when they run the script:

	     runfiche
	 
	 that starts the program, their environment will be able to find it.


 2.  CRRES_DATA_DIR

	 This indicates the directory location of the CRRES data files.
	 For instance, if your local directory of CRRES data is:

	      /disks/data/crres

	 you should set this variable, in you ".cshrc" file, with the line:

	     setenv  CRRES_DATA_DIR  /disks/data/crres

 3.  FICHEPRINTER

	 This indicates the name of your local printer - it should be a
	 PostScript printer as that is the printer file format that
	 "fiche" outputs.

	 For instance, if your local PostScript printer is named:

	     hplj1

	 your ".cshrc" file should contain the line:

	     setenv  FICHEPRINTER  hplj1

	 When you invoke the "print" button in "fiche", this will be the
	 printer that output will be sent to.

 4.  FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH

	 This indicates the directory location of your personal "fiche"
	 plot/datafile configuration file(s).  In particular, you will
	 have a file in this directory, called:

	     fiche.cfg

	 that contains all of the plot/datafile configurations that you
	 save from the "fiche" program.

	 This is a change from pre-1999 versions of "fiche" which utilized
	 the same "fiche.cfg" for each installation of "fiche" and required
	 that the program be run from the $CRRES_FICHE_BIN directory.
	 This is no longer true.  No user should now run the program from
	 $CRRES_FICHE_BIN and each will have their own set of plot/datafile
	 configurations (in their individual $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH directory).

	 The user must have both Read and Write permissions to the

             FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH

	 directory and, preferably, should own it.

	 As an example, if your home directory is:

	       /disks/home/user1

	 and you want to store your "fiche" plot/datafile configuration
	 information in the directory:

	       /disks/home/user1/fiche_configs

	 then you should, in your ".cshrc" file, have the line:

	     setenv  FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH  /disks/home/user1/fiche_configs

	 Since "/disks/home/user1" is your home directory, you could, in
	 this case, have also used the line:

	     setenv  FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH  $HOME/fiche_configs

	 but it is not required to make "FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH" an immediate
	 sub-directory of your home directory.

	 Also note that it is not required that you run "fiche" from your
	 FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH directory.  However, you should, of course,
	 run the program from a directory that you have Read/Write permissions
	 to, as the program does output some information to files called:

	     stdout
	     stderr

 5.  Initialize your file:

	     $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH/fiche.cfg

     Even for the first time that you invoke the "fiche" program,
     you must have a correctly formatted version of the file:

	     $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH/fiche.cfg

     You can get such a file in one of two ways:

     a)  If there are no other "fiche.cfg" files around at your site,
	 or if you really want to start from scratch, you can get a
	 nearly empty, but correctly formatted, prototype from the file:

             CRRES_FICHE_BIN/fiche.cfg.blank

         Copy this file into:

	     $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH/fiche.cfg

         with the commands:

	     cp  $CRRES_FICHE_BIN/fiche.cfg.blank \
		 $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH/fiche.cfg

	     cp  $CRRES_FICHE_BIN/blank.OPcfg  $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH

         The "blank.OPcfg" file goes with the "blank" configuration that
	 is inside the "fiche.cfg" file.  You do not need to know what
	 these ".OPcfg" files are - they are created and used as needed by
	 "fiche" and are stored in the "FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH" directory.

	 They may be one or two configuration other than "blank" in
	 your new "fiche.cfg" file - you should probably ignore them.

	 When you bring up "fiche", and look for plot/datafile configurations
	 to invoke, you can start with the "blank" configuration (which in
	 fact may not really be blank) and add/delete plots as needed and
	 then rename this configuration (so the "blank" configuration will
	 still exist in the configuration list).   The "fiche" program can
	 have as many of these configurations as you wish.  They are stored
	 in the file:  

	     $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH/fiche.cfg

     a)  You can copy an exising "fiche.cfg" into your FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH
	 directory.   If you do this, you should also copy all of the
	 ".Opcfg" files from that directory in FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH.  For
	 instance, if you are copying "fiche.cfg" from directory:

	       /disks/old/fiche_stuff

	 then you should do it by issuing the following 2 commands:

	     cp  /disks/old/fiche_stuff/fiche.cfg  $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH
	     cp  /disks/old/fiche_stuff/*.OPcfg  $FICHE_CONFIGS_PATH

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the program:
-------------------

1.  Once "fiche" has been installed locally and once you have set up
    your environment as related in:

        User Setup for the CRRES "fiche" program:

    you should be able to start the program, from anywhere that you
    have Read/Write permissions, with the command:

	runfiche

2.  The "fiche" window will appear with a list of plot/datafile
    configurations.   Select one of these and you should either
    see data plots or perhaps an error message indicating that
    the orbit file in the configuration is not avaiable (i.e. not
    in your:

       CRRES_DATA_DIR

    directory.   You can reconfigure this configuration with the
    "FileName" entry in the configuration menu.  A list of the
    available files will appear.

3.  There are a lot of things that you can do - the best thing is
    to test the program and learn how to add and delete plots in
    a configuration, zoom in and out, change the number of plots
    per page, etc.

4.  Be aware that you select the "current" plot by moving the Up
    and Down arrow keys.  The "current" plot will be bordered by
    a thick black rectangle.

5.  When you "Delete" a plot, the plot that is deleted is the
    "current" plot, as selected in step (4).

6.  When you "Add" a plot, the plot that is added after the
    "current" plot, as selected in step (4).

7.  If there are many plots in the configuration, you can move up
    and down a page at a time by pressing the "PgUP" and "PgDn"
    keys.

8.  To "pop" off menus, hit the ESCAPE key.   You can exit the
    program by hitting ESCAPE as often as needed.  Sometimes, just
    before exiting, you will have to indicate whether you want your
    changes to the current configuration to be accepted (in the
    "fiche.cfg" file).
